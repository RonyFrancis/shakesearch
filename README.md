# ShakeSearch

ShakeSearch is a simple web application to display William Shakespeare plays based on the users search query.
You can see a live version of the app at
https://shakesearch-rony.herokuapp.com/. Try searching for "Hamlet" to display
a set of results. 

## My Mission

Improve the search backend. Think about the problem from the user's perspective
and prioritize your changes according to what you think is most useful.

## My Changes
1. Changed the output to show the entire play based on query rather than sentences containing the query.
2. Made the search query to be case-insensitive for better user experience
3. Output is shown in a more structured manner

## Future Changes
### Frontend Changes
1. Better frontend ui 
2. Remove "," that is coming from the frontend
3. Autocomplete for user

### Backend Changes
1. Average time for response is 1.5 sec. It can be deceased using caching
2. Pagination to improve response Time
3. Better test coverage
4. Better code structuring

## Submission
